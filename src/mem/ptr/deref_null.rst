Null pointer dereference
========================

Dereferencing null pointer might have harmful effect on the application or the
complete operating system.

Impact
~~~~~~
In case there is no page assigned to null address, accessing data by that
address and all adjacent addresses will terminate the application. For the
kernel mode, the defect will panic the kernel.

Vulnerability potential
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This issue has a potential to be a vulnerability.

1. Since the default behavior is to terminate the application or panic the
   kernel, this defect might be used as a part of Denial of Service attack.
2. The termination of application might open other security issues in complex
   systems, leading to the attacker gaining access to the system.
3. If attacker has an access to signal handler, this defect may be used to
   perform remote code execution.

Technical details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The issue comes from memory management unit (MMU) de-facto conventions. When
such a memory access occurs, the operating system looks up the page in the page
table. The address range of the page containing null address is
historically not mapped to any page on most systems, leading to SIGSEGV signal
(on POSIX systems), which by default terminates an application.
On Windows and Visual C++ compiler with Structured Exception Handling (SEH),
the

Microcontrollers
****************
Beware that most microcontrollers have null address page mapped to the vector
of interrupt handlers. Changing the value on that address may have serious
impact and may come unattended.



Catching the issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are methods to catch the issue in runtime, however, you must be
assured that the signal handler may actually recover the program from the issue,
otherwise, you risk to have the handler invoked repeatedly.

Linux
*****
Set up the ``SIGSEGV`` signal handler to catch the issue.

Windows
*******
Use ``__try``/``__except`` if the compiler supports Structured Exception
Handling (Microsoft Visual C++ does).
